*Mybrary*

Mybrary is a social sharing app that catalags items between your friends, work, or relatives.  

It is simple to use. Just join a group, list your items, and request items.   

How the exchange goes down: You request an item from a user. Once a user is notified of your request, he brings the item to you next time he meets you. Then the lender marks approved on the request list and returned when it is returned. Mybrary does the rest.
